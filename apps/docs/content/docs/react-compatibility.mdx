This guide provides instructions for configuring assistant-ui to work with React 18 or older versions.

## React 18

If you're using React 18, you need to update the shadcn/ui components to work with `forwardRef`. Specifically, you need to modify the Button component.

### Updating the Button Component

Navigate to your button component file (typically `/components/ui/button.tsx`) and wrap the Button component with `forwardRef`:

```tsx
// Before
function Button({
  className,
  variant,
  size,
  asChild = false,
  ...props
}: React.ComponentProps<"button"> &
  VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> & {
    asChild?: boolean;
  }) {
  const Comp = asChild ? Slot : "button";

  return (
    <Comp
      data-slot="button"
      className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}

// After
const Button = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLButtonElement,
  React.ComponentProps<"button"> &
    VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> & {
      asChild?: boolean;
    }
>(({ className, variant, size, asChild = false, ...props }, ref) => {
  const Comp = asChild ? Slot : "button";

  return (
    <Comp
      data-slot="button"
      className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))}
      ref={ref}
      {...props}
    />
  );
});
Button.displayName = "Button";
```

**Note:** If you're using a lower React version (17 or 16), you'll also need to follow the instructions for that version.

## React 17

For React 17 compatibility, in addition to the modifications outlined for React 18, you must also include a polyfill for the `useSyncExternalStore` hook (utilized by zustand).

### Patching Zustand with patch-package

Since the assistant-ui uses zustand internally, which depends on `useSyncExternalStore`, you'll need to patch the zustand package directly:

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install use-sync-external-store patch-package
# or
yarn add use-sync-external-store patch-package
```

2. Add a postinstall script to your package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "patch-package"
  }
}
```

3. Create a patch for zustand by creating a file at `patches/zustand+5.x.x.patch` (replace 5.x.x with the installed zustand version, which you can find by examining `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) with the following content:

```diff
diff --git a/node_modules/zustand/react.js b/node_modules/zustand/react.js
index 7599cfb..64530a8 100644
--- a/node_modules/zustand/react.js
+++ b/node_modules/zustand/react.js
@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@
 'use strict';

-var React = require('react');
+var React = require('use-sync-external-store/shim');
 var vanilla = require('zustand/vanilla');

 const identity = (arg) => arg;
@@ -10,7 +10,7 @@ function useStore(api, selector = identity) {
     () => selector(api.getState()),
     () => selector(api.getInitialState())
   );
-  React.useDebugValue(slice);
+  //React.useDebugValue(slice);
   return slice;
 }
 const createImpl = (createState) => {
```

4. Run the postinstall script to apply the patch:

```bash
npm run postinstall
# or
yarn postinstall
```

This patch replaces the React import in zustand with the polyfill from `use-sync-external-store/shim` and comments out the `useDebugValue` call which isn't needed.

**Note:** If you're using React 16, you'll also need to follow the instructions for that version.

## React 16

<Callout type="info" title="Incomplete Section">
  This section is incomplete and contributions are welcome. If you're using
  React 16 and have successfully integrated assistant-ui, please consider
  contributing to this documentation.
</Callout>

For React 16 compatibility, you need to apply all the steps for **React 18** and **React 17** above.

## Additional Resources

If you encounter any issues with React compatibility, please:

1. Check that all required dependencies are installed
2. Ensure your component modifications are correctly implemented
